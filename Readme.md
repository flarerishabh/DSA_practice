# My Codeforces Problem Solving Journey 🚀

Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my Codeforces repository! This is where I track my progress as I solve problems and improve my algorithmic skills. Each problem I solve is a learning experience, and I’m constantly growing and challenging myself to tackle more complex problems.

## About Me

I’ve recently started solving problems on **Codeforces**, and this repository serves as a log of my solutions. I’m here to learn, improve, and have fun with problem-solving in a competitive programming environment. 

My goal is to practice regularly and keep pushing my limits, step by step, and gradually sharpen my skills. 

## What’s Inside?

In this repository, you will find:

- **Problem Solutions**: Each folder or file contains the code for a specific problem that I've solved.
- **Progress Tracker**: A quick glimpse of my progress and a summary of the problems I’ve tackled so far.

## Why Codeforces?

I chose **Codeforces** because it’s a fantastic platform that offers a vast variety of problems, ranging from easy to highly challenging. It has an active community, and solving problems there is a great way to level up my problem-solving and coding abilities.

## How I Solve Problems

I like to approach each problem by:
1. **Understanding the problem**: Taking time to read the problem carefully.
2. **Breaking it down**: Identifying the key concepts and logic that will help solve the problem.
3. **Coding the solution**: Implementing the solution in my preferred language.
4. **Testing and debugging**: Ensuring the code runs as expected and covers all edge cases.
5. **Learning from others**: After solving a problem, I like to read other solutions to learn new techniques and improve my coding style.

## Tools & Languages I Use

- **Programming Language**: I mainly use **C++** for Codeforces problems, but I may experiment with other languages too.
- **IDE/Editor**: My go-to editor is **Visual Studio Code**. Sometimes I use **JetBrains CLion** for a smoother C++ experience.

## How You Can Contribute

While this repository is my personal log, I’d love to engage with others who are also learning and solving problems on Codeforces. Here’s how you can contribute:

- **Comment on Solutions**: If you have any suggestions for improving my code or have better solutions, feel free to drop a comment!
- **Share Ideas**: If you have any tips or resources for improving my competitive programming skills, I’d love to hear them!

## Getting Involved

If you're also solving problems on Codeforces or interested in competitive programming, let's connect! Feel free to fork this repository and share your progress, or even collaborate on problems.

## Future Goals

Here’s what I hope to achieve:

- **Solve problems consistently**: Set a goal to solve at least one problem each day.
- **Participate in contests**: Start taking part in Codeforces contests to test my skills under time pressure.
- **Master Data Structures & Algorithms**: Work through various algorithmic paradigms to deepen my understanding of the fundamental concepts.

## Conclusion

Thanks for checking out my Codeforces journey! 🚀 Whether you're here to learn, suggest improvements, or just curious, I appreciate your interest. Problem-solving is a continuous journey, and I’m excited to see how far I can go!

Let's keep learning and growing together. 💪

Happy coding! 🧑‍💻👩‍💻
